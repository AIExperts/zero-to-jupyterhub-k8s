"""
Script to list *all* contributors to a given set of repos,
between a set of dates. This includes:

- Everyone who has made a commit merged between those dates
- Everyone who has opened or commented on an issue between those dates
- Everyone who has opened or commented on a PR between those dates

If you think this misses people who make contributions of a specific
form, feel free to add them here!

This script outputs a markdown formatted list of contributors
in casefolded name (username if name not specified) order.

Since we will be making a ton of requests to the GitHub API, you
need a GitHub API Token to use this script. The easiest way is to
just get a Personal Access Token (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).
Treat this token similar to how you would treat a password!
You can pass this token in with `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` environment
variable. For example,

  $  GITHUB_API_TOKEN="your-token" ./tools/contributors.py

Note that if you put a space before your command, it does not
get stored in your bash history (by default)!. Look up `HISTCONTROL`
to learn more about this feature of shells.
